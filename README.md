# multi-output-nn
In this short jupyter notebook, I will be explaining the details and steps of a basic multi output neural network  in a regression style NN. Dataset credit to https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/242/energy+efficiency. I've also used some code from Laurence Moroney's Coursera Course, so credit to him as well.
